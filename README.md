# Robot Unicorn Attack :carousel_horse:

A simple copy of [Robot Unicorn Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Unicorn_Attack) game, created for my Basic of Programming classes. I coded this project at the time when I was not so familiar with C++ and OOP in C++, code is a little bit messy :see_no_evil:, however I'm really proud of myself that I managed to make such a good looking game with lack of skills long time ago :hourglass:.
